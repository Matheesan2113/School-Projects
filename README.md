# School-Projects

This is a folder containing most school projects I completed. The coding aspect for both projects was done mostly by 
me(Trying to be modest but teams don't always work out to be fair).

COE528:
A transpotration booking application made using Java primarily. The main point of this project was to incorporate 
object oriented programming and use some design patterns.

COE888:
The main part of this project was actually not the code but rather the planning, the design of teh software that we did create.
The software was already specified to us in business requirements. As software engineering candidates we were told to create designs using 
design pattern knowledge and create plans on how this project would be completed. We created various UML diagrams, some of which you can 
find in the folder and created a project management plan.
